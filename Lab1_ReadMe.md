# Lab 1 - Nia Hill
For the very first lab, I was assigned to create a **greyscale composition** that resembles outerspace or a cityscape, and I chose **space**. 
This assignment made me familiar with the basics of p5js, such as the **appropriate layout** for this language compiler, and how to add basic
**shapes** with certain **strokes**.
